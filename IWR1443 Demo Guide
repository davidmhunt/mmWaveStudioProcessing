FLASHING THE BOARD
Ensure the board is disconnected from power.
Move the jumpers (black covers on the pins) to pins SOP0 and SOP2.
Connect the red board to power and USB.
Open UniFlash and load C:\ti\mmwave_sdk_02_01_00_04\packages\ti\demo\xwr14xx\mmw into Meta Image 1
Go to "Settings & Utilities" and change the COM port to COM3 (or whichever is the XDS110 Class Application/ User UART port, you can check in device manager under Ports)
Go back to program and click "Load Image"
Done
