Setup is similar to the IWR1443, refer to that guide.

When used with the data capture card, you need to adjust the jumpers (DCA1000EVM mode, page 44 of the guide), and also power the card separately. Change the switch on the card to "DC_JACK_5V_IN".

The jumpers for this board are the same as the dipswitches. Follow the chart on page 43 of the guide for settings. 

If you have everything set up properly but UniFlash/mmWave Studio can't seem to connect to the board, you may have a driver issue - refer to page 59 for installation info.

Make sure you only have one process using that card - remember to close the demo, for example.

Remember to power cycle (turn off and on) the card between flashes.
